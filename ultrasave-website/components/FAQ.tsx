  {
    q: "How much does UltraSave cost?",
    a: "UltraSave is 100% free forever. There are no hidden fees or premium versions. We earn revenue purely through unintrusive AdSense/AdMob ads within the applications."
  },
  {
    q: "Are my downloads safe and secure?",
    a: "Yes. All video and audio downloads occur directly on your local device using the open-source yt-dlp engine. Your network traffic goes straight from your device to the video platform."
  },
  {
    q: "Does UltraSave support downloading Private Videos?",
    a: "Currently, you must download publicly accessible or unlisted videos. Private videos that require login are not technically supported inside the core without supplying cookies."
  },
  {
    q: "Will I get IP banned from YouTube for using this?",
    a: "No. Unlike other server-side downloading tools that get IP-banned frequently, UltraSave uses your own local IP address exactly like you were browsing YouTube natively."
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms are supported?",
    a: "UltraSave supports over 1000+ websites including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, Reddit, and Vimeo."
  },
  {
    q: "How to use UltraSave Android?",
    a: "You can find an interesting video in your browser or YouTube app, tap 'Share', and select UltraSave from the list. It will automatically fetch and prompt you to download!"
